## Description

Responsive and Adaptable, this Adam Murphy's Portfolio animation is based on CSS and is supported by JavaScript. Projects load-in as images in a clockwise motion leaving the center for a short bio. Images react to the pointer hovering over them and displays a short description of the project's scope. If you click-on the image it will load the GitHub repo page for the specific project, in which you can find a direct link to the published version in the description.
